# SQL Practice
This repo is a place to store some projects as I practice SQL

## Projects
1. **Create a Simple Database**
   - Overview: Create a simple database with a single table. For example, you could create a table to store information about books with columns like title, author, and publication year.
   - Skills: Basic SQL syntax for creating tables (`CREATE TABLE`), inserting data (`INSERT INTO`), and querying data (`SELECT`).

2. **Filter and Sort Data**
   - Overview: Practice filtering and sorting data in your database. Write queries to retrieve books published after a certain year, or sort books by author.
   - Skills: Using `WHERE` clause for filtering, `ORDER BY` clause for sorting.

3. **Aggregate Functions**
   - Overview: Learn about aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `MAX/MIN`. Calculate the total number of books in your database, or the average publication year.
   - Skills: Understanding of aggregate functions and how to use them in SQL queries.

4. **Joins**
   - Overview: Introduce joins to combine data from multiple tables. Create another table, like one for storing authors, and join it with the books table to retrieve information about books and their authors.
   - Skills: Understanding of different types of joins (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) and how to use them to combine data.

5. **Subqueries**
   - Overview: Learn about subqueries by writing queries within queries. For example, find books by authors who have published more than a certain number of books.
   - Skills: Writing subqueries, understanding how to use them effectively.

6. **Data Modification**
   - Overview: Practice modifying data in your database. Update existing records, delete records, or add new columns to your tables.
   - Skills: Using `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `ALTER TABLE` statements.

7. **Indexes and Optimization**
   - Overview: Learn about database optimization techniques. Create indexes on columns in your tables to improve query performance.
   - Skills: Understanding of indexes and their impact on query performance.

8. **Normalization**
   - Overview: Normalize your database by breaking down tables into smaller, related tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
   - Skills: Understanding of database normalization principles (e.g., 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form) and how to apply them.

9. **Transactions and Locking**
   - Overview: Learn about transactions and locking in databases. Practice using transactions to ensure data consistency and prevent concurrency issues.
   - Skills: Understanding of transaction management and how to use locks to control access to data.

10. **Advanced Queries and Analytics**
    - Overview: Dive into more advanced SQL features and analytics. Write complex queries to analyze trends in your data, such as identifying best-selling authors or predicting future sales.
    - Skills: Advanced SQL querying techniques, possibly involving window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), or other advanced features.
